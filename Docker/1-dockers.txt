--- Containers ---
- Containers are lightweight, standalone packages that 
contain everything needed to run a piece of software - 
the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 
Think of them as isolated environments that bundle an 
application with all its dependencies.
-- benefits:
- consistency: It works on any machine becomes it works everywhere
- Lightweight: Unlike VMs, containers share the host system's
kernel, making them much smaller and faster to start
- Isolation: Each container runs independently, so apps don't 
intergere with each other.

--- Docker ---
- it is platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers.
- it it a tool that made containers accessible and practical for everyday developers
- Docker provides:
	- Docker Engine: The runtime that actually runs containers
	- Docker images: Read-only templates used to create containers (like a recipe)
	- Dockerfile: A text file with instructions to build an image
	- Docker Hub: A registry where you can find and share container image

--- Docker Image ---
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains instructions 
for creating a container. Think of it as a blueprint or snapshot.
-- Key characteristics:
- Static and immutable: once built, it doesn't change
- Layered filesystem: built in layers, where each layer represents an instruction from the Dockerfile
- Shareable: can be stored in registries like Docker Hub and shared with others
- Reusable: one image can be used to create many containers
- Example: An Ubuntu image with Python installed, or a Node.js image with your application code.


--- Docker container ---
A Docker container is a running instance of an image. 
Think of it as the actual execution of the blueprint.
- Key characteristics:
- Dynamic and mutable: it's a live, running process that can change state
- Writable layer: adds a thin writable layer on top of the image
- Isolated: runs in its own isolated environment
- Temporary: when stopped and removed, any changes not saved to volumes are lost

--- Docker vs Virtual Machines ---
--- Architecture Difference
This is the fundamental difference between them:
-- Virtual Machines (VMs)
-Run a full operating system for each VM
- Use a hypervisor (like VMware, VirtualBox) to virtualize hardware
- Each VM includes a complete OS, binaries, libraries, and the application
- Hardware-level virtualization

-- Docker Containers
- Share the host OS kernel
- Use containerization to isolate processes
- Only include the application and its dependencies
- OS-level virtualization

** When to Use What?
-- Use Docker Containers when:
- You need to deploy many instances quickly
- You want lightweight, fast deployments
- You're running microservices
- You need consistent development/production environments
- You're working with the same OS family (Linux containers on Linux)

-- Use Virtual Machines when:
- You need complete OS isolation
- You need to run different operating systems (Windows on Linux host)
- You require strong security boundaries
- You need to run legacy applications requiring full OS
- You want to simulate entire hardware environments
