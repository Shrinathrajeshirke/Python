1. Supervised Learning 
Definition: Learning from labeled data where you know the correct answers.
How it works: You train the model with input-output pairs, and it learns to predict outputs for new inputs.
Example - House Price Prediction:

Training Data: Houses with features (size, bedrooms, location) AND their actual prices
Goal: Predict the price of a new house based on its features
The model learns the relationship between features and prices from labeled examples

Common Algorithms:

Linear Regression (predicting continuous values)
Logistic Regression (classification)
Decision Trees, Random Forests
Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning 
Definition: Learning from unlabeled data where you don't have correct answers.
How it works: The model finds hidden patterns, groupings, or structures in the data on its own.
Example - Customer Segmentation:

Data: Customer purchase history (what they bought, how much they spent, frequency)
Goal: Group similar customers together without being told which groups exist
The model discovers that customers naturally fall into groups like "budget shoppers," "luxury buyers," "occasional purchasers"

Common Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Anomaly Detection

3. Reinforcement Learning 
Definition: Learning through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.
How it works: An agent takes actions in an environment, receives feedback (rewards/penalties), and learns the best strategy over time.
Example - Teaching a Robot to Walk:

Agent: The robot
Environment: The ground/terrain
Actions: Moving legs forward, backward, adjusting balance
Rewards: +10 points for each step forward, -5 points for falling
Learning: The robot tries different leg movements, falls many times (penalty), but gradually learns which movements keep it balanced and moving forward (rewards)

Key Components:

State: Current situation (robot's position, balance)
Action: What the agent can do (move leg, shift weight)
Reward: Feedback signal (positive or negative)
Policy: Strategy the agent learns (what action to take in each state)
